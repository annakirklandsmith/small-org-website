<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
        We typically hold in-person meetings on the last reasonable Monday of the month. To peruse and register for upcoming events, or peruse past events, please see our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataScientistaSociety/">Meetup site</a>. 
        Our meeting tradition is to go around the room and give each participant a chance to answer <i>What is the best/worst thing that happened/will happen to me in my private/personal life during the last/next month?</i> (Thank you, <a href="https://leanin.org/">LeanIn.org</a>)

<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Current Programs</h5>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Book Club</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Every two months, the group chooses a data-oriented book to all read, via survey. These books are written for a wide audience, so anyone can participate. We women are busy, and we never require that the book be finished. 
    When at our best, we provide alternate material, such as a TED talk, by the same author, for a shorter time frame of preparation prior to the meeting. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliakzn/">Julia Kuznetsova</a> moderates our Book Club currently.

</ul>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Newsletter, the QUICK LIST </h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Meeting attendance includes completing a <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KlCERIcb3sbaRzEUdfA439p7jzZz6UF61S15340EG88/">questionnaire</a>. 
    The answers are compiled into a monthly newsletter, the <i>Quick List</i>.
    We are looking at applying technology to eliminate the manual aspect of the newsletter in a project called <a href="redcoat.html">Redcoat</a>.
</p>

        </li>
        
 </ul>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Reverse Book Club</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Every two months, data scientistas take turns sharing about a non-fiction read.
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Annual Event</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    In October, the last month of the meeting year, the Society hosts an annual event. 
    In 2017, the Future Fair featured a panel of six guests from surrounding colleges and training programs. You can see our video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hfLfH0s48Y">here</a>, and the web page archive <a href="futurefair2017.html">here</a>.
    In 2018, we held a member survey and un-contest of analyzing survey results. 
    To learn about the 2019 Future Fair, see the <a href="futurefair.html">Future Fair</a> page.
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Annual Planning and Other Planning Meetings</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    The meeting in November is dedicated to reviewing metrics from the previous year and choosing future goals and leaders.
    This meeting, and any other meetings to plan events, is open to anyone, always.

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Past Programs</h6>


<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Partner Presentations</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Women in this field are so rare that often they work on all-but-totally-male teams. 
    To get women the experience and pleasure of working on a technical project with another woman, we encourage partners to work on a project and present together.
    In fact, having a partner is a requirement for any presenter.

    </ul>




<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Amplification Project</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    A member may share a capstone project (along with GitHub repository) to the group, and the group will explore how it can be amplified.
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">TED Talks</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Similarly to Book Club, TED Talks prompt discussion among members. Everyone can watch an un-announced video about a data topic (preferably of a woman speaker) together and then discuss it. 
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Livestream of Women in Data Science Conference</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    A great way to learn from women who have gone before us is to watch their presentations streaming from the <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/">Women in Data Science Conference</a>.
</p>



<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Classes by members</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Every now and then, a data scientista prepares a special lecture, tutuorial, or co-working series. 
</p>

<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Future Programs</h5>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">CAP Program </h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    We have divided the Certifiend Analytics Program vocabulary terms into clusters. 
    We would like to analyze member data to find data scientistas who have experience in those respective clusters.
    Knowing them, we could arrange a series of meetings around each topic.
