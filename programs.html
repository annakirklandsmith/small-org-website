        We typically hold meetings on the last reasonable Monday of the month. To peruse and register for upcoming events, or peruse past events, please see our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataScientistaSociety/">Meetup site</a>. 
        Our meeting tradition is to go around the room and give each participant a chance to answer "What is the best/worst thing that happened/will happen to me in my private/personal life during the last/next month?" (Thank you, <a href="https://leanin.org/">LeanIn.org</a>)

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Book Club</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Every two months, the group chooses a data-oriented book to all read, via survey. These books are written for a wide audience, so anyone can participate. We women are busy, and we never require that the book be finished. At our best, we provide alternate material, such as a TED talk, by the same author, for a shorter time frame. Julia Kuznetsova moderates our Book Club.
