<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    We, the members of the Data Scientista Society, are the definers of what a <i>data scientista</i> is. But you guessed correctly already: it's a friendly blend of <i>data scientist</i> and <i>sister</i>.
    We are here to support one another. Here's how we described ourselves at the <a href="futurefair2017.html">2017 Future Fair</a>:

<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Expectations for Members</h5>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Register through Meetup.com</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    The first step to becoming a data scientista is to register through the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataScientistaSociety/">Meetup site</a>. 
    This site holds the organizational calendar with upcoming events, where a scientista can RSVP to 
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">LinkedIn Profile</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    If there is one requirement for membership, it that the LinkedIn profile is supplied when the data scientista signs up through our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataScientistaSociety/">Meetup site</a>.
    Many of our activities, such as mentions in the newsletter, depend on having this profile.
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Attendance</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    A data scientista, you,  has a lot on her shoulders and a lot on her mind. 
    This organization has been designed as "open house": you will come when you can. 
    Ultimately, if the value you get out of the relationships and programs is worth the time to show up, we will see you.

</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Ranking and Newsletter</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    That said, we reward attendance, because we need you in-person to build relationships with you!
    Traditionally, women who come to the meeting have the option of being listed in the two following newsletters, the "Quick List".
    Annually, activity data is fed into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"> page rank algorithm</a> to determine member ranking, which is used in several potential ways: consensus building, leadership selection, expense reimbursement, and more. 
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Data Scientista Society followers</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    A LinkedIn group called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8496042/">Data Scientista Society followers</a> is how fans, allies, and the general public can interact with the group.

</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Thoughts Related to Gender </h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    We welcome everyone and anyone of any gender spectrum. However, we reserve the assumption that any participant is a she/her while with us, wants to be called a she/her while with us, and that she needs to nourish her she/her side (since we offer that nourishment).
    Also, we are take-space-make-space organization, meaning that we want any one to share, but also space must be made to allow others to share, too.
    <br><br>
    We are very greatful to allies who can help us with the logistics of meeting: we are always looking for free, secure, accessible, technology-laden environments, or couches, with plenty of parking, for meeting spaces.
    <br><br>
    If you are pregnant, congratulations. However, we are not going to say anything unless you mention it first.
