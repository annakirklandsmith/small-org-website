<h4 class="mdc-typography--headline4">What is a data scientista?</h4>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    We, the members of the Data Scientista Society, are the definers of what a data scientista is. But you guessed correctly already: it's a friendly blend of "data scientist" and "sister."
    We are here to support one another. Here's how we described ourselves at the <a href="futurefair2017.html">2017 Future Fair</a>:

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    The best aspect of having our own concept is so that we can be as inclusive of as many kinds of data-related careers as possible. 
    Among us are many kinds:

<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Expectations for Members</h5>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Register through Meetup.com</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Body
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">LinkedIn Profile</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    If there is one requirement for membership, it that the LinkedIn profile is supplied when the data scientista signs up through our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataScientistaSociety/">Meetup site</a>.
    Many of our activities, such as mentions in the newsletter, depend on having this profile.
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Attendance</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    A data scientista, you,  has a lot on her shoulders and a lot on her mind. 
    This organization has been designed as "open house": you will come when you can. 
    Ultimately, if the value you get out of the relationships and programs is worth the time to show up, we will see you.

</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Ranking and Newsletter</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    That said, we reward attendance, because we need you in-person to build relationships with you!
    Traditionally, women who come to the meeting have the option of being listed in the two following newsletters, the "Quick List".
    Annually, activity data is fed into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"> page rank algorithm</a> to determine member ranking, which is used in several potential ways: consensus building, leadership selection, expense reimbursement, and more. 
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Data Scientista Society followers</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    A LinkedIn group called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8496042/">Data Scientista Society followers </a> is how fans, allies, and the general public can interact with the group.

</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6">Gender Etiquette</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    We don't actually care what your gender is, or how you define it. We do care that you do not make yourself the center of attention and do care that all your actions and behaviors mirror the group actions, behaviors, and values.
    We reserve the assumption that you are a she/her, that you want to be called a she/her while with us, and that you need to nourish your she/her side (since we offer that nourishment).
    <br><br>
    If you are looking for ways to support the group outside of meeting participation, we are always looking for free, secure, accessble, technology-laden environments, or couches, with plenty of parking, for meeting spaces. We'd be very thankful if you can help us with that.
    <br><br>
    If you are pregnant, congratulations. However, we are not going to say anything unless you mention it first.
