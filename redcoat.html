<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5 redcoat5">What if there were apps for modern women's groups?</h5>

<p class="mdc-typography--overline">
"Though women . . . don't have to engage in that sort of competion [that men have in men's groups], they also don't have the opportunity to change their position in the group's heirarchy." 
<br><br>Deborah Tannen in <i>You're the Only One I Can Tell</i>
</p>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
Despite any view of women's groups, women find membership in a supportive group to be one of the the greatest sources of satisfaction in their lives.
<br><br>
How can we leverage technology give more and more women a positive group experience? Who better to answer that question than a group of technical women?

<h5  class="mdc-typography--headline5 redcoat5">How the Data Scientista Society Dreamed a Dream</h5>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    You may have navigated via a hyperlink from anywhere. Notice, you haven't landed on the pitch page of some snazzy startup. 
    Instead, you have found a website of a group of women dedicated to supporting one another against all odds.
    They found, however, that their growth was stunted without automating their processes. 
    They could continue to hobble along, or, they could apply their talents for enabling women's group everywhere.
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Attendance Survey-to-Newsletter Pipeline</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    At each meeting, members sign in, along with completing a questionnaire, with such questions as, "Are you looking for a job?" "Are you hiring for a job?"
    The organizer would collect these surveys at the end of every meeting and manually compile them into a monthly newsletter, which included news items about the group as well.
    This monthly newsletter not only created a sense of community, but helped women find jobs, proving that tech women can and do support one another. 
    Manually, creating the newsletter is burdensome. 
    However, creating the app to take attendance and collect survey data and convert all data into simple newsletter is doable.

                </li>

            </ul>


<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Attendance Analytics to Accelerate Consensus</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    What can be gleaned from attendance data? Assuming attendance is a subsitute variable for eye contact, we can use techniques from social network analysis to rank or weight members. 
    This weighting can be used to prioritize, reward, the most active members -- which is exactly what eye contact does. 
    The ranking can be used for many purposes: identify project owners based on the commitment of their attendance; create a reimbursement queue; distributed limited perks; quantify consensus. 
    In the end, the ranking makes leadership less burdensome, so leadership is less likely to burn out. 
    Members can remain engaged, because their place in the heirarchy is not fixed, but changeable, based on thier attendance. 
    All of this is possible through an app that easily collects attendance data.

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Attribute Data to Grow and Leverage Competencies</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    All support groups and success groups exist to get the members from some state A to a better state B. 
    Usually, Better 'B' impart their wisdom and knowledge.
    In the case of career groups, skills and other attributes are capture in LinkedIn data. 
    With an app in which members can upload their LinkedIn data, the data can then be compiled and analyzed.
    Clustering techniques will allow to identify a group of B members with an expertise to share with A members.
    The group can also analyze the data to make sure programs are successfully converting A members to B members, for any given attribute.

<h5  class="mdc-typography--headline5 redcoat5">Next Steps</h5>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
        We hope you are familiar with the mantra "one day at a time". 
        However, we will be reaching out to find partners. 
        Meanwhile, here are the next steps.
</p>




<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Survey about Women's Groups</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    We have received advice to use Lean Startup principles. 
    One interpretation is to create a survey for women about women's groups. 
    This survey would not suggest that there is a product or solution to women's group woes.
    The survey would simply explore women's involvement and outcomes with women's groups, such as longevity and satisfaction, and use of technology.
    We would use the survey to prove the existence of a market of technology to meet the needs of women's groups.

        </li>
    </ul>



<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Future Fair Alliance</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    It is important to cultivate a culture of entire tech women's groups working together. 
    Many different skills, technical or otherwise, will be necessary for a successful project. 
    Towards this end, an event called the <a href="futurefair.html">Future Fair</a> begins to introduce groups to one another.

        </li>
    </ul>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Create a Minumum Viable Product</h6>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Clearly there is a need for a minimum viable product for the attendance-to-newsletter pipeline. 
    The project can be open-source on Git, coded in Python with the Django framework. 
    One member of the Data Scientista Society has completed a 12-week immersive program in this technology.
    We invite any members of any of the allied groups to participate.

</div>

<h5  class="mdc-typography--headline5 redcoat5">Investment Proposition</h5>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Body.
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Target Customer</h6>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    While women's groups is the core market of this application, the true target market is any success group, support group, or community empowerment group
    that is likewise volunteer dependent, cooporative, connecting, and exists to get members from an observable state A to state B. 
</p>


<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Market Plan</h6>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    The plan is that, once we have a minimum viable product (MVP) for the attendand-to-newsletter pipeline, we invite the 
    alliance of women's groups who participated in the Future Fair to beging using the app.
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Revenue Plan</h6>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Once the MVP is stable, and has a value proposition for non-technical women's groups, we begin to invite other local women's groups to use the app, at a small fee per person, per group.
    The data belongs to the group that supplies it. However, the possiblity remains for any group to donate its data to be used for further purposes. 
    For example, the Data Scientista Soceity may license its data to be used in school that teaches women data science.
    <br><br>
    A legacy opportunity is clearly created: while there has been much analysis of largely male sports teams and armed forces, there is little study of women's groups. 
    Humanity has a missing pocket of knowledge that can be filled. 
    In support of this project, the Data Scientista Society is fulfilling its vision of a world full of data of the women, by the women, for the women.

        </li>

        <h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat">Competition</h6>

        <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
            There are platforms that are for groups, or social platforms that offer a side dish of group, 
            but all these platforms fall short of supporting the leaders who hold themsleves responsible for growing the group. 
            When the leader quits from exhaustion, or the group quits an unsupported leader, what happens next?
            <br><br>
            Meetup takes attendance, but does not complete the cycle with a newletter/communication piece. 
            Alerts and bulletin boards are far from the structured, routine communication that builds a sense of community and grows the group. 
            Facebook is ubiqutious, but doesn't allow data-driven management of the group.
            Git fosters contributing community, but that community is for technical people doing technical work, not women voting on books for book club. or groups making decisions nearly as formally as Robert's Rules.
            LinkedIn, with good conscience, doesn't provide a (non-recruiter) group leader access to combined profile data in analytics.
            All of these platforms can serve a group, but what is necessary is a central app glueing them together to ensure group growth.

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Risk</h6>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Right now, the proposed growth plan is organic. This growth plan may not be fast enough for many investors. 
</p>

<h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 redcoat6">Team and Partnership</h6>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Much of the leadership of the Data Scientista Society is in support of this project, but there are others.
